//! What the Teams views follow, which read is due, and the updates a reply
//! gives. Pure and clock-driven, so tests replay real replies without `hgs`.
//!
//! A follow names the team list, the Waiting list and at most one watched
//! team. The watched team's status, inbox and newest feed page are read every
//! [`POLL`], as are the list and Waiting when followed (Qt's 3 s
//! `TeamController` poll); older feed pages, spans and the profile are read on
//! request. A reply becomes an update only when the view it projects differs
//! from the last one sent for that key, so an unchanged team costs a read and
//! nothing more. Keys: `list`, `waiting`, and `team:`, `graph:`, `new:`,
//! `feed:`, `inbox:`, `spans:`, `profile:` followed by the team id.
