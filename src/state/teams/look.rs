//! Task 139 (owner, 2026-11-07, the Adventure team): `hgs team status` often
//! named a member's state wrong (working while it waited on an approval, a
//! Kimi prompt not read, a delivery left in the composer), and the lead had to
//! be kicked by hand. Each source's view of a member is compared:
//!
//! - hooks: the session record the native hooks and events keep (activity,
//!   phase, a question or approval it reported);
//! - record: a request Zerus read from the session (`pending`,
//!   `terminal_question`);
//! - screen: the Terminal's recognised panel (a question or approval, a draft
//!   in the composer, an idle prompt, a working spinner);
//! - process: whether its process runs, its own jobs and Zerus builds;
//! - activity: the time of its last event against the stuck bound.
//!
//! Sources that disagree beyond `GRACE` make the member `uncertain`, with the
//! disagreeing views named; it is never shown as a confident `working`. A tool
//! call that is open (Claude's `active_tools`, a DeepSeek session's PreToolUse
//! with no result after it) and a Zerus build the member waits for are work,
//! held to the tool bound, never silence (task 181). The
//! screen is read only for a suspect member, at most `MAX_CHECKS` at a time and
//! off the dispatcher's tick. `hgs team look <member>` gives the same compact
//! snapshot in one call, and an uncertain member is told to the lead once.
