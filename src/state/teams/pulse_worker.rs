//! Task 185: a member's turn-end pulse is built off the dispatcher's tick.
//!
//! The build reads the member's session (`hgs inspect --skip-processes`, 15 s
//! bound). A member on a hung ssh host made that a 15 s wait inside the tick
//! for every one of its turn ends; so the tick only queues the job and goes on.
//! One thread works the queue in order and ends when it is empty; the next tick
//! stores what it built. Both queues are bounded, and nothing here touches the
//! store: the dispatcher owns it.
