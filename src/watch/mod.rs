//! `hgs [@host] watch --json`: one long-lived NDJSON event stream per computer
//! (ABI `watch-v1`, frames in `crates/watch-protocol`). The catalog topic
//! carries the rows of `hgs ls --json --local --no-archives`; Activity carries
//! what `hgs inspect` returns for subscribed sessions, and git what `hgs
//! git-status --json` returns for subscribed checkout folders. Change detection
//! is a 250 ms pulse over cheap stamps and the journal's data version, on
//! `std::thread` only. A changed binding or journal row derives only its
//! session's row again; a 5 s probe watches what no file shows and the whole
//! listing runs every 5 s. See "Event stream" in docs/reference.md.
